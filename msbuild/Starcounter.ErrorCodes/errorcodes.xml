  <!-- 
  Header file containing all Starcounter error codes. Note that error code 0 is reserved 
  for no error (the operation was successful). 
  
  Error code standards: 
  
  1. EVERY error should have an error code. Note that errors that hasn't a corresponding 
     error code is assigned the unspecified error code so they to have an error code. This 
     error code should be reserved for user code only however (non Starcounter code). 
     
  2. EVERY error code should be defined in this file. This way we can keep track of which 
     error codes exists and a common source for documentation (with the bonus that it's 
     easier to avoid duplicates). 
     
  3. EVERY error code should be placed in the correct category (see below). 
  
  4. An assigned error code must never be reused. To clarify: If the error code 5 is removed 
     then no error code added in the future is allowed to be assigned the value 5. The reason
     for this is to avoid having users, or software, recognizing the error code to make the 
     wrong assumption as to which error it refers to. 
     
  5. An error code should, if possible, be so specific that it pinpoints a specific type of 
     error in a specific module. General errors like "can't write to file" should be avoided.
     If a log file couldn't be written to because the disk was full this should be indicated 
     by a different error code then if a backup couldn't be completed for the same reason. 
     This way an error code could indicate a specific error without any additional data. 
     
  6. When an error occurs that requires additional data to be interpreted it should be logged 
     separatly and generate another, more general error, indicating that the first error occured. 
     We refer to this as an internal error. Typically an internal error isn't an error that 
     can be caused by, or handled by, the caller. An example is when an unexpected file error 
     causes something like a backup to fail. In order to see what the problem is it will probably 
     help to have things like path information and the underlying error code. We therefore log an 
     "unexpected backup error" and send an error to the caller with an error code indicating that 
     backup failed: see log files for more information. This is also a good approach because you 
     often can't trust user code to log errors correctly, making sure an error is logged correcly 
     before passing it on to the caller is a good way to make sure there is relevant information 
     about the error available. Critical errors that takes down the process also falls under this 
     category (can't write to transaction log, assertion failures etc.). 
     
  7. Error codes must be documented in order by value in this file (an error code with the value 5 must 
     be placed after an error code with the value 3 but before an error code with the value 6). The 
     reason for this is simply because it's easier to read as documetation and it's easier to assign a 
     new error code since it's easier to determine which error code currently has the greatest value. 

  8. No error code definitition is more then 32 characters in length.
  
  9. When formulating error messages, consider the design guidelines used when designing exception
     messages. Please consult any of these resources for guidance:

        http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2004/01/28/64255.aspx

     Longer error messages gain from being divided into a compact "brief" as a first sentence,
     formulating the problem. If so, the error coding API's can be used to show the brief in a
     title-like context and the full message in a longer section below.
     
     Example:
     
     "The database can not start because the executable file could not be found in the
     installation folder."
     
     can be rewritten as
     
     "The database could not start. When trying to start the database, the executable file
     was not found in the installation folder."
     
  Error code categories: 
   
  1. General error. Error codes that doesn't fit in any of the other groups. Out of memory is a a
     good example, it can occur anywhere. 
  
  2. Startup and shutdown error codes. Codes for errors occuring during database startup or shutdown.
     Usually caused by a faulty installation, bad application arguments or faulty configuration
     settings.
     
  3. General I/O error codes.
     
  4. Database error codes. Codes for database errors that can be caused by faulty user code or
     transactions as well as errors that is the result of some previous internal error (like if
     unable to create dump).
  
  5. Session errors.
  
  6. Unexpected internal errors. Usually representing unexpected errors returned from API
     functions, corrupted files or invalid input.
  
  7. Sql provider errors.
  
  8. Transaction abort codes.
  
  9. (Not used; removed)
  
  10. Management error codes. Codes that pinpoints different management tasks, such as the starting,
      stopping, deleting of databases, communicating with servers (i.e. management servers) and such.
      These codes are used in management components such as the client hosting management library and
      in tools/components built on top of that, such as Starcounter Administrator and our Visual
      Studio extensions.
      
  11. Installer error codes.
      
  12. Development specific error codes. These codes represent problems that are specific to the
      development of Starcounter code libraries and clients.

        <para>
          A cooperatively scheduled worker thread is considered unresponsive when it hasn't yielded
          for more then a minute but this error isn't generated unless the thread has been
          unresponsive for a user configured period of time (2 minutes by default). If a thread is
          detected to be unresponsive but not long enough for the error to be generated, a warning
          is generated instead.
        </para>
        <para>
          The error is likely caused by an infinite loop or a deadlock but could also be caused by
          the thread doing something that doesn't give it the opportunity to yield for a very long
          period of time (which also is a real problem since the stall timeout is configured in
          minutes).

          The code loader requested to iterate types in a given (loaded) assembly, but this operation
          resulted in an error. This usually indicates some kind of reference error where one assembly
          or module references (direct or indirect) a type that was implied for the former to load
          properly. Results in a code loader error in the critical error log. See about this above. In
          companion with this error, Starcounter writes out what assembly failed to load. This might be
          enough for the developer, but if it isn't, even more information is availible. To get this
          additional and extended error information, the error in the error log comes equipped with a
          reference number (in the form of a GUID). This reference number can be used to find the information
          lining up with the given exception. To search for this information by reference, consult the
          Starcounter.Notice log. In the complementary log the following can be found:

          To use Starcounter binaries in a client application, the build system must prepare
          the code for client access during compilation. This is normally done in Visual
          Studio, under the project property page "Starcounter" in a Starcounter Library
          project. Make sure you set the "Enable access from external process" to TRUE.

      <remarks>
        Accessing an object that has been deleted before the transaction started could also cause the

        accessed within another transaction then the transaction the object was fetched in and the object
        at that time has been deleted. The reason for this is that the database engine can't determine when
        the object was deleted and therefore assumes that the object existed when the transaction started
        because of the assumption that the reference was fetched within the current transaction. To avoid
        this one should only access objects fetched within the context of the current transaction is possible.
